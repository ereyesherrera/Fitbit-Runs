# Clustering GPS Tracker Run Activity

## About

At the end of 2021, I replaced my Fitbit GPS tracker with a Garmin watch. I realized that I would no longer be able to access 3 years worth of running and biking data I accumulated on my Fitbit since I would no longer be accessing my Fitbit account. Therefore, I thought I'd turn this situation into a small machine learning project to: 1) download all GPS data that Fitbit provides and 2) analyze each GPS activity and group them together to learn about the type of activities I accumulated between 2019 and 2021.
